# Q# Sample for Basic Quantum Arithmetics (Adder, Substracter, Multiplier, and Exponentiation)

There exist several researches to reduce qubits or improve performance for Quantum Arithmetics. (See "[Circuit for Shor's algorithm using 2n + 3 qubits](https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0205095v3.pd)", "[Fast Quantum Modular Exponentiation Architecture](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1207.0511.pdf)", etc.)    
But this source code implements quantum addition, subtraction, multiplication, and exponentiation by the straight forward logics without any modification (tuning and improving) for the purpose of your learning.

See my post "[Programming Quantum Arithmetics (Adder, Multiplier, and Exponentiation)](https://tsmatz.wordpress.com/2019/05/22/quantum-computing-modulus-add-subtract-multiply-exponent/)" for the background of this sample code.
